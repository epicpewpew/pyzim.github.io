## Code Of Conduct

* * *

### Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of the PyZim Community pledge to making participation in and at Community affiliated events and spaces a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, ability, ethnicity, tribe, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Community Standards



* Be respectful and considerate.
* * *
    **Be welcoming and open-minded.** Other Community members may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new members and those just getting started.

    **Respect each other.** Nothing sabotages healthy conversation like rudeness. Be civil and professional, and don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Don’t harass or grief anyone. Treat each other with dignity and consideration in all interactions.

    You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content, and knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

    **Communicate with empathy.** Disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Being part of a community means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. If you disagree with someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you address them. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.

### Contribute in a positive and constructive way.

* * *
    **Improve the discussion**. Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

    The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.


    Additionally, the PyZim community  is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done.

    Share mindfully. When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context.

### Be trustworthy.

* * *
    Always be honest. Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community Forum members. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. GitHub staff will also be active in the Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help
